		  <p>As soon as you start reading through this website you will realize that creating a Video-Game is neither too difficult nor too easy, if you have the skills and the required gadgets.</p>
		  <h2 align="center">What You Need???</h2> 
	   <ul>
	   <li>A Gaming Laptop(Windows OS)</li>
<li>1TB Hard Disk</li>
<li>Xbox 1 Remote</li> 
</ul>
<h2 align="center">What Do You Need To Know???</h2> 
<ul>
<li>A Programming Language</li>
<li>A Rough Idea Of How Game Engines Work</li>
<li>Knowledge Of Being A Hardcore Gamer</li> 
<h3>Part 1: Selecting A Video-Game Developing Engine</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned above that you need to know a programming language, I didn't mention any programming language. That is because there are many game engines and each one uses a popular programming language. I highly reccomend to you C++. Why? Because video-game engines are usually made using C++ </p>
<table border="10">
	<tr>
	<font color="Red"><td bgcolor="Red">C++</td>
		<td>Unreal Engine 4</td>
		<td>CryEngine 5</td>
		<td>Panda3D</td></font>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td bgcolor="Green">JS</td>
	<td>Unity3D</td>
	<td>BabylonJS</td>
	<td>Turbulenz</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td bgcolor="Grey">C#</td>
	<td>Unity3D</td>
	<td>Xenco</td>
	<td>Wave</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td bgcolor="Yellow">HTML5</td>
	<td>Quintus</td>
	<td>Coco's 2D</td>
	<td>Canvas</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td bgcolor="Pink">Python</td>
	<td>Panda3D</td>
	<td>Blender3D</td>
	<td>Pygame</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
	<p>There are many more game engines but these game engines use programming languages that are used by most people in video-game development, software development, app development and website development.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Deciding On Your Video-Game</h3>
<p>It is really upto you, whether you want to make a 2D video game or a 3D video-game, Action or Fiction, it really is upto you. If you want to make a video-game in a short time then make a 2D video-game or if you have the time and budget then create a 3D video-game. <br>
The good thing about creating a 3D video-game is that more people will be more than satisfied with it but it will be pretty much time consuming and the good thing about 2D video-games is that it can be made in a short amount of time.
<br><hr>
<h3>Part 3: Assemble Your Tools</h3>
<p>3D video-game development requires additional tools to make it perfect while 2D video-game development doesn't require additional tools.</p>
<br><hr>
<ul>
<li>Autodesk Maya or 3d's Max or Blender 3D</li>
<li>zBrush</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 4: Start Your Work</h3>
<p>Open Microsoft Words or Notepad on your computer and type down  the video- game's objective. If you want it to have a proper storyline like GTA V and AC Creed Syndicate then right down it's storyline. If it is a freestyle game like Subway Surfers and Temple Run then begin with the game.<br>
If you are creating a 2D game, remember that it is fully programming while 3D games are just part code. If you are making a 2D video-game then you have to be an expert in programming.
<br><hr>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>From now on I am going to be talking about 2D video-game development in the first paragraph and 3D video-game development in the 2 paragraph.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>Part 5: Level</h3>
<p> While creating a 2D video game we are to start with the levels. Let's take GTA V for an example. The city you see around your character is a level. When you are playing Subway Surfers and jumping on top of trains and diving under obstacles it
is a level. A video game can have infinite levels. It is upto you to decide how a level should look. So, if you want to create a 2D Spider Man video game then you would probably program a New York City.<br><br>
3D video game development is not too different from 2D video game development. If you are creating an Open World video game like Assassin's Creed then you would have to create a city or a desert or a forest. It depend's on your game's storyline. In 3D video game development you will encounter basic shapes like cube and sphere. Using those shapes you can create buildings or whatever you like.</p>
<br><hr> 
<h3>Part 6: Creating Your Characters</h3>
<p>Creating characters in 2D game development is not that easy but it depends on your game's objective. So if you want to create a simple game like what Ketchapp publishes I suggest you to create basic shapes and create a simple game like Jelly Jump. <br><br>
Creating characters 3D video-game development is even tougher than 2D development. You need to be experienced in 3D Modelling as
well as programming. For those who don't want to do 3D Modelling can use:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Fuse</li>
<li>Character Creator</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these softwares come in with readymade humans and it is upto you to decide how they look what they wear, etc.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>Part 7: Animating Your Character(s)</h3>
<p>2D character animation doesn't require extensive knowledge in video game development. It is
very easy to animate characters especially in 2D video game development. So if you want to create a character who is running and jumping then you don't need to write hundreds of lines of code. All you need to do is open Photoshop or whatever you prefer and make a character. So an array of pictures will make an animation if played in a fast speed. That's how most of the 2D games are made. But if your character is a simple shape you need to create a button that when pressed it will go right or left or jump.<br><br>
Animating 3D characters is easy as well as difficult. All the game engines I have suggested to you use sockets for animating characters. So you have to basically click on the point you want your sicket to be on(on the character). So you might want to put a socket on the character's neck, hand, shoulder, etc. I can only take you this far in animating your character because each one animates the character differently. You have no choice but to watch a YouTube/Vimeo video to find out.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>Part 8: Placing Your Character(s)</h3>
<p>Placing your characters in a video is as easy dragging and dropping. If not then you will have to program it which will be nearly as easy. It has to be well planned so if you are creating a game like Mario Run then you have to place the characters in such a way that the levels/missions your customers play is not impossible. It is easy to place the characters in the video game but planning it will be time consuming so 2D games take less time than 3D video games do.<br><br>
While creating a 3D video game all you have to do is drag and drop but they will have to be tested every time. This process is often time consuming and will need patience(I really don't have any patience but as I am an experienced video game developer I can manage to do it). </p><br><hr>
<h3>Part 9: Assembling Your Game's Storyline</h3>
<p>Assembling your storyline is easy. If you are creating a 2D video game you have to program that after you reaching a certain point a person comes out and says something and then you have to follow that person and all. This paragraph applies for 2D video game development as well as 3D video game development.</p><br><hr><h3>Part 10: Packaging And Publishing Your Video Game</h3>
<h4>This is the final step and this again applies for 2D video game development as well as 3D. You have to first search up how to package your game as each game engine has a different way of packaging. After you package your game open the game engine's official website and see what devices it can make games for. If you want to release the app for iOS or Android you will have to pay a $25-$100 developer fee. After you pay the money you have to download Xcode for Apple Devices and Android Studio for Android Studio. Run your game on these 2 softwares and release it on App/Play Store.</h4><hr><hr><hr><hr>
